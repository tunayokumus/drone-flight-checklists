 - [ ] Temperature within drone's operational limits.
 - [ ] KP index for magnetic storms below 5.
 - [ ] Flight route avoids No Fly Zones.
 - [ ] No strong electromagnetic interference sources (mobile/radio towers, electrical wires, or metallic objects) nearby.

### Hardware:

   2- On high winds set the RTH altitude lower so it can RTH at lower speeds.
 - [ ] Take-off & immediate flight area free from obstacles and people
 - [ ] Hover to check for abnormalities before full flight.
